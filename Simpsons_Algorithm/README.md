This function takes a vector (x) of spaced independent variable data, and a vector (y) of the corresponding dependent variables as inputs. The algorithm checks to see if both vectors are equal length and if the independent variable vector (x) is equally spaced. If these factors are met, the algorithm then integrates the data using Simpson's (1/3) rule and the trapezoidal rule on the last interval if needed. The output is the value of the integrated inputs.
